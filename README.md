# **Hearts of Fun 4 - Version 1.0r1**

After playing HOI4 for many years (It ruined me ðŸ˜…), something I always disliked in both single-player and multi-player was the chronic lack of resources. So, here is a mod to fix that and provide a better incentive to conquer historically strategic locations.

## **Current Features in Version 1.0r1:**

### **Increased Division Limit for Generals & Field Marshals:**
- Generals: 60 Divisions
- Field Marshals: ~

Reflecting both historical and gameplay balance, you will find advanced resources in the following locations:

### **Europe:** 
- Rome, Warsaw, Paris, Rhineland, Moselland, Brandenburg, Scotland, London

### **Soviet Union:** 
- Kiev, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Moscow

### **Asia & Pacific:** 
- Japan, Iwo Jima, China

### **Africa & Middle East:** 
- Algeria, Cairo

### **USA:** 
- East Coast, West Coast

This new distribution makes these regions more valuable early on, creating dynamic battles over resource-rich areas and changing the strategic landscape.

### **Major resource zones:**
- Oil: 36
- Rubber: 36
- Aluminum: 122
- Tungsten: 122
- Chromium: 122
- Steel: 122

### **Minor resource zones:**
- Oil: 9
- Rubber: 9
- Aluminum: 61
- Tungsten: 61
- Chromium: 61
- Steel: 61

Some zones (Scotland, Kiev, Algeria, Cairo) have reduced resources for gameplay balance.

## **What's Next?**
I don't have much time besides college but I may update this in the future with more ideas I have. Hereâ€™s a sneak peek at whatâ€™s to come:

- **Inspired by Road to 56:** The ability to construct resources on the map. Youâ€™ll be able to develop your nationâ€™s industry further by investing in resource production, adding more layers of strategy to the game and extending its lifetime.
